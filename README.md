# cfmailchimp
Mailchimp ColdFusion Rest API Client

This client is a bit of an overlapping mess, it includes v1, v2 & v3 api calls, but
it has pretty great coverage, including some older apis that were removed. I'll work
on cleaning it up, any help appreciated.

## To Install
Run the following from commandbox:
`box install cfmailchimp`

## Changes
2019-05-31 Open source release
